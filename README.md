## üìù Description:
* We use Kaplan-Meier survival curves to investigate the effect of pathological tumor stage and the age of the patients on the overall survival rates of breast cancer.

* Predicting cancer staging in the patient using TCGA BRCA clinical and gene expression dataset using different models like Random Forest Survival, ANN and K-Nearest Neighbour to find out the most effective model
* We have used unsupervised learning methods like clustering on gene expression dataset to find potential patterns in the genomic data. 

* Clusters are used to improve supervised learning models and increase their predictive capabilities.

## ‚åõ Dataset:

* To retrieve the data, we have used a R package called TCGAbiolinks. Package is freely and easily accessible in the Bioconductor Project at http://bioconductor.org/packages/TCGAbiolinks.

* Clinical and gene expression data is prepared using GDC query using TCGAbiolinks package in BCR.Biotab format.

### :pushpin: Preparing Clinical Supplement Datset in R:
```
# Extracting clinical data
gdcProject<- getGDCprojects()
TCGAbiolinks::getProjectSummary("TCGA-BRCA")

query <- GDCquery(
  project = "TCGA-BRCA",
  data.category = "Clinical",
  data.type = "Clinical Supplement",
  data.format = "BCR Biotab"
) 

query_output<- getResults(query) 
GDCdownload(query)

clinical.BCRtab.all <- GDCprepare(query)

```

### :pushpin: Preparing Gene Expression Dataset in R:
```
# Extracting Gene Expression Data

GDCproject<-getGDCprojects()
TCGAbiolinks::getProjectSummary("TCGA-BRCA")

  query_TCGA <- GDCquery(
    project = "TCGA-BRCA",
    data.category = "Transcriptome Profiling",
    data.type = "Gene Expression Quantification",
    experimental.strategy = "RNA-Seq",
    barcode = c("TCGA-*")) # 
    parameter enforced by GDCquery
GDCdownload(query_TCGA, method = "a
pi", files.per.chunk = 100)

getResults(query_TCGA)
tcga_gene<- GDCprepare(query_TCGA, s
ummarizedExperiment = TRUE)
gene_matrix<- assay(tcga_gene, 'unstranded')
```

* Patients around the age of 60 come to know about the tumors in their breast around this age in their life.

* The boxplot shows an analysis of the distribution of the current age across three racial groups; White, Black or African American and Asian.

* Invasive and Non Invasive cancer categorisation is achieved using analysis of Tumor Size, Node Stage and Metastasis Stage

## ü©∫ Survival Analysis of patients using clinical dataset:

* While looking for impact of age on Overall Survival of patients, with the p-value of 0.62, the Kaplan-Meier curve shows no significant change across various age-groups.
<img width="1151" alt="surv2" src="https://github.com/Gauravonthemixx/Text-Analytics-of-TED-Talks/assets/91785440/78be4e93-bdec-482d-8d75-c6bcd7c4a3ae">
* While looking for impact of tumor stage on overall survival of patients, with the p-value of 0.00015, it shows the importance of the difference of the tumor stages and the survival chances. It shows the tumor stage to be a powerful prognosis at the time of the diagnosis for the overall survival of breast cancer patients.

## üìà Result of Classification Model (Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Methods):
### Invasive and Non-Invasive cancer type classification:- 
* The Random Forest model performed extremely well in terms of precision and recall. The ANN model performed well in recognising invasive cancer, but it showed slightly less performance with non- invasive predictions. The KNN model displayed low performance for both the types of cancer as it struggled to predict the imbalanced class type.

### Cluster analysis using PCA and K-Means:
* PCA is used to resolve high dimensional dataset into two principal components.
* The Elbow method is used to select the optimal number of clusters by choosing the k-value.
* The silhouette score reached its peak at 0.3929, showing similarity among the resultant clusters.

### Feature selection using Random Forest Method:-
* For each gene, an AUC score was determined, and the top 51 genes, each with an AUC score exceeding 0.7, were filtered for an in-depth examination, indicating their better predictive capacity. In our findings, particularly, the genes ‚ÄòSHE; and ‚ÄòSLC19A3‚Äô stand out with their higher importance scores.

### Improved classification models using engineered clusters of genes: 
* We performed cross-validation, the 5 -fold method is used to predict the performance of the machine learning models. The improved scores are shown below with the new improved ROC-curve.
