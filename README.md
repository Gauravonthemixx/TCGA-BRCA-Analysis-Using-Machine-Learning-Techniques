# :rocket: Comprehensive Study of Clinical and Gene Expression TCGA Breast Cancer Data Using Machine Learning Techniques

## 📝 Description:
* We use Kaplan-Meier survival curves to investigate the effect of pathological tumor stage and the age of the patients on the overall survival rates of breast cancer.

* Predicting cancer staging in the patient using TCGA BRCA clinical and gene expression dataset using different models like Random Forest Survival, ANN and K-Nearest Neighbour to find out the most effective model
* We have used unsupervised learning methods like clustering on gene expression dataset to find potential patterns in the genomic data. 

* Clusters are used to improve supervised learning models and increase their predictive capabilities.
